# LibraryAPI :books: :bank:

- Your Local Libraryâ„¢ has decided to get with the times and hire a competent pair of full stack developers to build a management application for their inventory. This application will allow employees to view and manage the books in the library. 
- The son of one of the librarians started on the back end, but didn't get very far as he is 7 years old. He fully implemented a JDBC Repository layer, as well as the Book and Author Classes before he lost interest. The service layer is empty, and the MVC Controller only has method stubs.
- You are tasked with **expanding and improving the codebase** found in this repo! Your tasks will be updated below as Deliverables.
- (Breaking character) We're going to add to this project every day for the rest of the week. It is meant to simulate an actual real world job with a stakeholder that's depending on you to build up an application according to their specs. E&Y wants to hire problem solvers that can think through tasks and provide a reasonable solution. There are many ways to fulfill these deliverables, and no specific right answer.


# Deliverable 1 (Tuesday)

### Hints

- The script for the entities and data are in this repo for you. Save yourself some time and just copy & run it in DBeaver.
- This API is not going to work right off the bat. You and your partner will need to fill in DB credentials in the ConnectionFactory, and the application.properties. Up to you if you want to spin up a remote database, or if you want one person coding and the other providing support.
- There is a rookie mistake in the Controller layer that will prevent the API from compiling. Figure out how to fix this "ambiguous" problem.
