# LibraryAPI :books: :bank:

- Your Local Libraryâ„¢ has decided to get with the times and hire a competent pair of full stack developers to build a management application for their inventory. This application will allow employees to view and manage the books in the library. 
- The son of one of the librarians started on the back end, but didn't get very far as he is 7 years old. He fully implemented a JDBC Repository layer, as well as the Book and Author Classes before he lost interest. The service layer is empty, and the MVC Controller only has method stubs.
- You are tasked with **expanding and improving the codebase** found in this repo! Your tasks will be updated below as Deliverables.


# Deliverable 1 (Tuesday)

- hi

### Hints

- The script for the entities and data are in this repo for you. Save yourself some time and just copy & run it in DBeaver.
- This API is not going to work right off the bat. You and your partner will need to fill in DB credentials in the ConnectionFactory, and the application.properties
- There is a rookie mistake in the Controller layer that will prevent the APi from compiling. Figure out how to fix this "ambiguous" problem.
