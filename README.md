# LibraryAPI :books: :bank:

- Your Local Libraryâ„¢ has decided to get with the times and hire a competent pair of full stack developers to build a management application for their inventory. This application will allow employees to view and manage the books in the library. 
- The son of one of the librarians started on the back end, but didn't get very far as he is 7 years old. He fully implemented a JDBC Repository layer, as well as the Book and Author Classes before he lost interest. The service layer is empty, and the MVC Controller only has method stubs.
- You are tasked with expanding and improving the codebase found in this repo! Your tasks will be updated below as Deliverables.
